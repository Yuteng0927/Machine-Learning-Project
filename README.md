Groundwater geochemistry data in Central Valley

## Overview
Californiaâ€™s central valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the world. Agricultural irrigation in these semi-arid agricultural regions heavily relys on the groundwater system. At the same time, with an increase in population, groundwater consumption is expected to increase. The result is that pumping from increasingly deeper parts of the aquifer has increased the rate of downward groundwater flow. This increasing gradient may enhance the concentration of geogenic contaminants, such as Chromium (Cr), Uranium (U) and Arsenic (As).
